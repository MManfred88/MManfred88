- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcello, analyst and developer on an Italian multinational corporation
- 👀 I’m interested in Oracle and all its environment
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and X++ for Microsoft F&O environment
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on PL/SQL open source projects
- 📫 How to reach me ... well, here of course

I have some years of experience in an obscure and unknown language called Centura (formerly Team Developer) that made me feel lonely.
So, I started learning PL/SQL and now Google can help me with my questions...

I earn my wage as IT project manager in the mechanical industry.


I am here to feel part of something bigger.
